# ozymandias

I met a traveller from an antique land<br>
Who said: “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
Stand in the desert . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:<br>
And on the pedestal these words appear:<br>
‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br>
**Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'**<br>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<br>
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
